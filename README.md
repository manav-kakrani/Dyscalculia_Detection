# Dyscalculia_Detection
This project addresses early dyscalculia detection in children through a user-friendly app. It administers math assessments, records response times, accuracy, and numerosity, and uses a Random Forest model trained on ICPSR data to predict dyscalculia risk. Results are displayed to inform parents, aiding early intervention and support.
